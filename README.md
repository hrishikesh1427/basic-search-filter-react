# Contact Keeper

A simple React application that displays a list of contacts with a search functionality. This app demonstrates basic use of React hooks (`useState`) and rendering lists with conditional filtering.

## Features

- Display a list of contacts (first name, last name, email, phone).
- Search for contacts by first name using a search bar.
- Real-time filtering of contacts based on the input in the search field.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-keeper.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd contact-keeper
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the App

To start the development server and run the app:

```bash
npm start
```
or

```bash
yarn start
```

This will open the app in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Project Structure

- **data.js**: Contains a list of contacts used in the app.
- **App.js**: The main React component where the contacts are displayed and filtered.
  
### How It Works

- The contact list is displayed in a table.
- You can search for contacts by their first name using the search bar. The table will update in real-time as you type, filtering the contacts that match the search query.

### Example Data Format

The contacts in the app use the following format (from `data.js`):

```javascript
const data = [
  { first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Doe', email: 'john@example.com', phone: '1234567890' },
  { first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Smith', email: 'jane@example.com', phone: '9876543210' }
];
```

### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language used to build the app.
